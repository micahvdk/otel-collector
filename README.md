# Multitudes OTel Collector

A custom [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) that runs in your network, aggregates AI usage metrics from your engineers, and sends them to Multitudes.

This approach means that raw data does not leave your environment.

## How it works

Tools like Claude Code emit raw OTLP metrics as engineers work. The Multitudes OTel Collector receives those metrics, aggregates them by user over a time window, and sends the aggregated totals to Multitudes. Individual activity data stays inside your network.

```
[Claude Code / AI tools] → [Multitudes OTel Collector] → [Multitudes]
         raw metrics            aggregated by user          totals only
```

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- A Multitudes Integration token (generated from within the Multitudes app)

## Quick start (Docker)

**1. Clone this repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/multitudesco/otel-collector.git
cd otel-collector
```

**2. Build the collector image**

```bash
docker build -t otelcol-multitudes:latest .
```

**3. Run the collector**

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name multitudes-otel-collector \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -e MULTITUDES_INTEGRATION_TOKEN=your_bearer_token_here \
  -e MULTITUDES_INTEGRATION_ENDPOINT=https://integrations.multitudes.co/ai/otel \
  -e MULTITUDES_DEBUG=1 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:4317:4317 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:4318:4318 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:13133:13133 \
  otelcol-multitudes:latest

# To disable verbose debug logging in production, omit the line above:
#   -e MULTITUDES_DEBUG=1 \
```

The collector is now running and listening for OTLP metrics on:
- `localhost:4317` — gRPC
- `localhost:4318` — HTTP

## Configuring your AI tools

Each person using Claude Code should enable exporting metrics to the OTLP endpoint. This can be done by configuring a `~/.claude/settings.json` file. This example exports OTLP metrics to the localhost endpoint exposed by the collector running in the Docker container:

```bash
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY": "1",
    "OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER": "otlp",
    "OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER": "otlp",
    "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL": "http/protobuf",
    "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT": "http://localhost:4318",
    "OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL": "10000"
  },
}

```

Once the collector is running as a deployed service, replace `http://localhost:4318` with the endpoint that the deployed collector exposes.

### Logging in
Each person sending Otel metrics should be logged in using their work email. This allows Multitudes to correctly match the incoming metrics to users in Multitudes.

## Configuration

The collector is configured via environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MULTITUDES_INTEGRATION_TOKEN` | Yes | Bearer token provided by Multitudes |
| `MULTITUDES_INTEGRATION_ENDPOINT` | Yes | Multitudes ingestion endpoint |
| `MULTITUDES_DEBUG` | No | Set to any non-empty value to enable verbose debug logging from the aggregation processor |

### Aggregation

The collector aggregates metrics by `user.email` over a 5 minute window before sending to Multitudes. This means:

- Raw per-request metrics are never sent externally
- Only per-user totals per time window are transmitted
- Reduction in network traffic

The aggregation window and other settings can be adjusted in `otel-collector-config.yaml`.


## Ports

| Port | Protocol | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `4317` | gRPC | OTLP metrics ingestion |
| `4318` | HTTP | OTLP metrics ingestion |
| `13133` | HTTP | Health check (`/health`) |
| `55679` | HTTP | zPages diagnostics |

## Deployment 

Deploy the collector onto your infrastructure and expose the required ports for Claude Code users to export metrics to. 

Specific configuration guides for common deployment patterns like ECS Fargate will be coming soon.
